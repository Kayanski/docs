# Vaults Architecture

Vaults are the container for assets implementing automated strategies, which generate yield. They offer auto-compounded yield generation capabilities on any supported chain. Written by third parties and approved for integration with Mars by the Martian Council, users can deposit assets into these vaults to participate in the automated yield generation strategies. Strategies could include:

- Yield farming governance tokens
- Liquidity provisioning on AMMs
- Other advanced features such as automated trading, options strategies, etc.

At any time, third parties can author or propose new vault strategies with custom risk parameters for Mars. If approved by governance, these strategies will be deployed and incorporated into Marsâ€™ credit accounts, so they can be used as collateral for other activities. Each credit account will also support multiple cross-collateralised vault positions. The first vault strategies are leveraged yield farming, which will be supported by the Fields of Mars.
