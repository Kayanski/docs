# Vaults Liquidations

Vaults are implemented as whitelisted strategies available for leverage through Rover credit accounts. This means Vaults use the same liquidation engine as Rover (i.e. if the HF drops below 1, the account is deemed at risk and is available to be liquidated). Additionally, note that since Rover tracks your HF across all your positions through a single liquidation treshold, other positions within the same sub-account may affect your Vaults position. 

Check out [Rover Liquidations](../rover/rover-liquidations) for more information.
