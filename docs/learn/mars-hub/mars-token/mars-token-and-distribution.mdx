# Distribution

Helping coordinate and align incentives of the different stakeholders involved, the MARS token is a key piece of the Mars ecosystem. The maximum supply of MARS tokens will be 1 billion and the final token allocation is as follows:

- **Token Claim (64.4M):** To be distributed to all persons who were $MARS-Classic token holders on Terra Classic as of the applicable snapshot periods, as described [here](https://mars-protocol.medium.com/unveiling-the-mars-airdrop-and-snapshot-data-ea4f3926f2ca). These tokens will be fully unlocked and claimable upon genesis.
- **Community Pool (635.6M):** Governed by the Martian Council. Some of the use cases of this pool of funds could include rewarding of staking/lending/borrowing, token grants and other community building programs.
- **Mars Contributors (300M):** Unlocking/vesting builder allocations. 1/3rd unlocks from a smart contract escrow on September 1, 2023, with the remainder unlocking linearly on a daily basis over the following two-year period. Vesting and other contractual restrictions may apply in addition to the smart contract lockup, depending on the particular token grantee.
