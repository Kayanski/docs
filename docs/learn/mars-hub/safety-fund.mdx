# Safety Fund

Shortfall events happen whenever the value of a borrower’s debt exceeds the value of the borrower’s collateral. This deficit is distinct from an illiquidity event, where utilisation rates are at 100% and lenders are temporarily unable to withdraw their deposits. In the latter case, the protocol is illiquid but solvent, whereas in a shortfall event the protocol is actually insolvent.

Shortfall events can be caused by various risks such as smart contract exploits, untimely liquidations, and/or oracle attacks. To be clear, they should not happen under normal conditions and can be mitigated by proper risk management. However, if a shortfall event does occur, Mars includes a backstop intended to limit losses. This backstop mechanism differs from the backstops in Mars v1.

Specifically, Mars v1 relied upon a pool of reserved aUST (the “Safety Fund”) as a first-resort source of recovery for shortfall events and staked Mars (the “Safety Module”) as a last-resort source of recovery, with up to 30% of any staked position being locked and sold in case of a shortfall event.

Mars v2 will feature a Safety Fund, but will not launch with a Safety Module as the staking model on Mars v2 is significantly more complicated and provides chain security. The Safety Fund will continuously receive a share of protocol fees (10% of total) from launch. Fees will be converted to axlUSDC and reserved in the Safety Fund pool. Governance could vote to compensate users affected by a shortfall via this fund. Governance could also modify the portion of fees allocated to the Safety Fund.

Ultimately, however, compensation cannot be guaranteed and is subject to the discretion of Mars governance. Based on the relevant incentives, though, Mars governance is expected to treat the Safety Fund as a coverage source of first resort.
