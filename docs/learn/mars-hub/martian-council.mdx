# Martian Council

The [Martian Council](../../govern/martian-council) — made up of MARS stakers and their delegators — is at the heart of Mars Hub and will govern whichever deployed instance of the Mars Protocol smart contract system and its outposts on other chains.

Ultimately, governance will be responsible for the scope and robustness of trading activity on Mars. Specifically, governance will be able to determine the following criteria:

1. The underlying DEXs that are whitelisted for trading.
2. The assets that are borrowable on the Red Bank. As mentioned above, this determines the list of assets available to be shorted and, in the case of stablecoins, allows for assets to be longed.
3. The risk parameters of assets added to the Red Bank: these ultimately determine the leverage a user can take on a given position.

The below figure shows how the process for whitelisting a DEX or asset into the Red Bank works.
