# MARS Token & Distribution

Helping coordinate and align incentives of the different stakeholders involved, the MARS token is a key piece of the Mars ecosystem. The maximum supply of MARS tokens will be 1 billion and the final token allocation is as follows:

- **Token Claim (64.4M):** To be distributed to all MARS token holders on Terra Classic as described here. These tokens will be fully unlocked and claimable upon genesis.
- **Community Pool (635.6M):** To be distributed at the discretion of the community. Some of the use cases of this pool of funds could include incentivisation of staking/lending/borrowing, token grants and other community building programs.
- **Mars Contributors (300M):** Subject to transferability restrictions for up to three years.
