# Borrowing Assets

### Step 3: Determining the Borrow Amount and Leverage

In this phase, specify the amount you want to borrow. The Mars dApp allows you to borrow an amount exceeding the collateral available in your account as long as the Health Factor (HF) remains greater than 1, essentially utilizing leverage.

Furthermore, you have the option to toggle the "Receive funds to Wallet" feature. When activated, this turns off leverage, permitting borrowing only by over-collateralizing your position. This means you can engage in DeFi activities on other protocols using your entire credit account as collateral for a loan.
