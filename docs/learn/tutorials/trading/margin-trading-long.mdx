# Margin Trading Long

This tutorial guides you through the process of setting up a margin trade with a long position on the Mars dApp. Engaging in margin trading allows you to leverage your existing assets to potentially maximize profits. Here’s how you can go about it:

### Step 1: Navigating to the Trade Page

To begin, head to the "Trade" page and toggle the "Margin" option on. This action enables the utilization of the total value of your account as collateral, allowing you to leverage additional assets, provided your position maintains a health factor greater than 1.

### Step 2: Choosing an Asset to Buy (Long)

Once set, proceed to select the asset you wish to buy or go long on from the available options.

### Step 3: Selecting an Asset to Sell

Typically, this would be a stablecoin. Engaging in a long trade means borrowing stablecoins to purchase more of the asset you’re bullish on. This strategy increases your exposure to the chosen asset, and should its value rise, you stand to profit when repaying the stablecoin debt.

### Step 4: Determining the Trade Amount

Specify the quantity you intend to trade. Notably, inputting an amount below the margin ticker will initiate a spot trade using the available collateral.

### Step 5: Leveraging Your Trade

By choosing an amount beyond the margin ticker, you activate the leverage option, borrowing stablecoins to increase your exposure to the asset you are longing.

### Step 7: Inspecting Balances

Post-transaction, inspect your balances. You will notice a stablecoin debt but increased exposure to the asset you longed. Successfully playing this long position can allow you to repay the debt at a reduced cost, securing a profit.
