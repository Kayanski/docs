# LP Farming

In this tutorial, we are guiding you through the simple yet rewarding process of engaging in LP farming on the Mars dApp. LP farming is a fantastic way to potentially earn rewards while helping to provide liquidity to the ecosystem. Let's walk through this process step by step:

### Step 1: Navigating to the Farm Page

Begin your LP farming journey by heading over to the "Farm" page, which can be found under the "Earn" section in the Mars dApp.

### Step 3: Setting up the LP Position

For the purpose of this tutorial, we will skip borrowing assets to leverage the farm position. While it is possible to utilize borrowed assets to enhance your farm position, we will focus on creating a basic LP position using your existing assets. Remember, this position can later be used as collateral for other leveraged activities such as trading or borrowing from the borrow page.
