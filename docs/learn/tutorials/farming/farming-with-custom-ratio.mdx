# Farming with Custom Ratio

In this tutorial, we will explore how to engage in LP (Liquidity Pool) farming using a custom ratio on the Mars dApp. This method provides greater flexibility, allowing you to potentially optimize your rewards and strategy. Let's dive into the steps:

### Step 1: Navigating to the Farm Page

Start by heading over to the "Farm" page, found under the "Earn" section. Here, choose a pair that you are interested in LP farming into.

### Step 2: Enabling Custom Ratio

For a more tailored approach, toggle the "Custom Ratio" option on. This feature allows you to set individual amounts for each asset in the pair, potentially optimizing your strategy.

### Step 3: Defining Your Custom Ratio

At this juncture, you get to select an arbitrary amount to provide for each asset in the chosen pair. Itâ€™s up to you how you want to allocate your resources; you even have the option to single-side LP if you desire, giving you more control over your position.

### Step 4: Skipping the Borrow Option

Although borrowing assets to leverage your position is a possibility, we will bypass this option for the purposes of this tutorial. Remember, your custom ratio position can still be utilized as collateral for other leveraged activities on the platform.
