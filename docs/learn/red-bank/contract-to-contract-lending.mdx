# Contract-to-Contract (C2C) Lending

Contract-to-contract (C2C) lending taps into a completely new source of borrowing demand for credit protocols: non-depositor borrowers (i.e., third-party smart contracts). This additional source of demand can lead to a significantly more competitive credit protocol, since it can create a virtuous cycle in which higher borrowing demand (from this new source) leads to higher utilisation rates, which leads to more deposits and so on. C2C loans power Mars' credit accounts, enabling leveraged yield farming in the Fields of Mars and later use cases which give users the ability to leverage their positions on any chain that has an outpost.

It’s important to realise that C2C loans, despite being distinguished from “collateralised” loans in this whitepaper, are not uncollateralised per se. While the smart contract receiving the loan doesn’t need to deposit collateral on the Red Bank in order to receive the loan (unlike regular users), mechanisms to ensure solvency must be implemented. Collateral is always required from the end user and is held by the C2C lending contracts, which are able to track the collateral's value and liquidate it if the position becomes unhealthy. In this sense, collateralisation happens at the borrowing contract level rather than at the Red Bank level, as it’s the borrowing contract that receives the loan.

In order for collateralisation at the borrowing contract level to matter, it needs to be accompanied by a sound liquidation engine. As such, borrowing contracts that wish to utilise C2C borrowing, including the credit accounts described in Section 4, must have liquidation logic implemented that ensures their ability to repay the debt regardless of market conditions. Developers are free to choose their preferred logic and parameters, but these must be approved by the Martian Council in order for C2C “credit lines” to be extended.
