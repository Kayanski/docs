# Two Slope Interest Rate Model

The Red Bank operates with a standard two-slope interest rate model (see Fig. 7). Pioneered by [Aave](https://github.com/aave/aave-protocol/blob/master/docs/Aave_Protocol_Whitepaper_v1_0.pdf) and [Compound](https://compound.finance/documents/Compound.Whitepaper.pdf), this model is battle-tested and widely used throughout DeFi. It works by targeting a certain utilisation rate (amount borrowed / amount deposited). Then, a curve is derived and implemented that aims to discourage utilisation past the optimal level by a sharply increasing slope, i.e. a sharply increasing interest rate.
