# Airdrop

Originally launched on Terra Classic, Mars Protocol has deployed Mars Hub: a new blockchain in the Cosmos galaxy. MARS token holders on Terra Classic as of two previously-announced snapshot dates can now claim MARS tokens directly on Mars Hub and help shape the future of the galaxy's most powerful borrowing and lending protocol.

### How does the claim process work?

<Admonition type="info" title="">
Airdrop claims will be possible at http://airdrop.marsprotocol.io/. Users will need two wallets to claim MARS tokens on Mars Hub: 
- Terra Station (or another wallet compatible with Terra Classic)  
- Keplr Wallet

You’ll first need to connect your Keplr wallet and add Mars Hub chain to generate a receiving address on Mars Hub. Then, you’ll need to connect your Terra Station wallet (make sure you’re using the address that’s eligible for the MARS airdrop). Once connected via Terra Station, you’ll need to sign a message with your Terra account’s private key verifying that you are the rightful owner of that address and specifying a Mars Hub address where you’d like to receive your MARS tokens. After the transaction, MARS will automatically be sent to your receiving address. The claims screens will walk you through the process.

### Which wallets are compatible with Terra Classic and can be used to claim the airdrop?

<Admonition type="info" title="">
Currently, eligible users can claim their airdrop using a combination of Keplr (for Mars) and Terra Station or Leap Wallet (for Terra Classic). Mobile wallets for Keplr and Terra Station are not supported.
</Admonition>

### I’m using Ledger with Terra Station. Can I claim the MARS airdrop? 

<Admonition type="info" title="">
Yes. However, Ledger does not support signing arbitrary messages. Therefore, Ledger users must import their recovery seed phrases into Terra Station to complete the signing process. Because importing your Ledger seed phrase into a Terra Station hot wallet exposes your seed to an Internet-connected device, it may weaken your Ledger’s security.

Furthermore, please note that Ledgers use a single seed phrase to generate secret keys for all blockchains (i.e. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cosmos, etc.) that you interact with using the same Ledger. This is a fundamental design limitation of Ledger, and Mars builders are not able to address it. Users with tokens on multiple chains should move all tokens (other than MARS Classic) to new cold wallets. 

If you do not wish to purchase a second Ledger, you can move your tokens to hot wallets and set up your Ledger as a new device with a new seed phrase so you can transfer funds back onto the Ledger after your airdrop claim has been executed. Please note that your tokens are at an elevated risk of loss for as long as they are associated with a hot wallet or other Internet-exposed keys, including those based on your original seed phrase.

### I’m not comfortable temporarily putting my crypto in a hot wallet. Are there any alternatives?

<Admonition type="info" title="">
You have a few options. The easiest is purchasing a second Ledger where you can transfer your funds before processing the MARS airdrop claim. Another option is using your Ledger to generate a new seed phase and transferring all your crypto to new addresses affiliated with that seed phase before processing your airdrop claim. That would require doing the following:

1. Set up your existing Ledger as a new device with a new seed phrase. We'll call your original seed phrase "Seed Phrase 1." The new seed phrase is "Seed Phrase 2." 
2. While using your Ledger with Seed Phrase 2, generate receiving addresses for all of the cryptos that you currently have on your Ledger (assets associated with Seed Phrase 1). Be sure to generate a Mars Hub address as well and save all those receiving addresses. 
3. Restore your Ledger with your Seed Phrase 1 and transfer all of your holdings to your new receiving addresses (addresses which are affiliated with Seed Phase 2). 
4. Claim your MARS airdrop and transfer it to your Mars Hub address affiliated with Seed Phrase 2. 
5. Restore your Ledger using Seed Phrase 2 and avoid using Seed Phrase 1 in the future.

### Where can I see if my airdrop arrived?

<Admonition type="info" title="">
Open Keplr and select Mars Hub. Your MARS tokens should automatically appear in Keplr after you complete your claim. The user interface at marsprotocol.io will also display a transaction hash where users can examine transaction details.
</Admonition>

### When will the airdrop go live?

<Admonition type="info" title="">
We don’t yet have an exact date, but the airdrop is expected to go live with the launch of Mars Hub.
</Admonition>

### Who qualifies for this airdrop? And when were the snapshots taken?

<Admonition type="info" title="">
Mars users who held MARS tokens during 1 or more the Terra Classic snapshots on May 7, 2022 (block height 7544910) and May 28, 2022 (block height 7816580).
</Admonition>

### I was staking MARS for xMARS. Will this be included in the airdrop?

<Admonition type="info" title="">
Yes. For xMARS holders, their airdrop will be calculated using the xMARS:MARS ratio at each snapshot. For example, if you hold 10 xMARS, and the exchange ratio was 1 xMARS = 1.1 MARS, then you will be credited the same amount of the new MARS tokens as if you held 11 MARS at the time of the snapshot.
</Admonition>

### How will MARS be divided between the two snapshot groups?

<Admonition type="info" title="">
Of the existing circulating MARS supply, 50% is going to MARS and xMARS holders in Snapshot 1, and 50% to MARS and xMARS holders in Snapshot 2. Learn more here.
</Admonition>

### Can I check my expected airdrop amount?

<Admonition type="info" title="">
Yes. The full list of eligible Terra Classic addresses is available in this spreadsheet. Note that all amounts in the spreadsheet are denominated in “umars” or “micro mars.” Each umars represents 1/1,000,000 of a MARS token. To calculate a given airdrop amount, divide the total number of umars by 1,000,000.
</Admonition>

### How long will the airdrop be active?

<Admonition type="info" title="">
No deadline has been set. Users will be able to claim their MARS tokens at any time. If this were to change, a deadline would be shared with the community on Medium and Twitter.
</Admonition>

### What is the total supply of MARS tokens and how much will be airdropped?

<Admonition type="info" title="">
The total supply remains unchanged at 1 billion. ~77 million MARS tokens are available in the airdrop, and the circulating supply will reflect the total number of tokens that are claimed.
