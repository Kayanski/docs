# Airdrop

Originally launched on Terra Classic, Mars Protocol has deployed Mars Hub: a new blockchain in the Cosmos galaxy. MARS token holders on Terra Classic as of two previously-announced snapshot dates can now claim MARS tokens directly on Mars Hub and help shape the future of the galaxy's most powerful borrowing and lending protocol.

### Who qualifies for the upcoming airdrop? 

<Admonition type="info" title="Answer:">
Terra Classic $MARS holders as of two historical snapshot dates:

- Block 7544910 (May 7, 2022)
- Block 7816580 (May 28, 2022)
</Admonition>

### How will MARS be divided between the two snapshot groups?

<Admonition type="info" title="Answer:">
Of the existing circulating MARS supply, 50% is going to MARS and xMARS holders in Snapshot 1, and 50% to MARS and xMARS holders in Snapshot 2.
</Admonition>

### When will the airdrop go live?

<Admonition type="info" title="Answer:">
MARS tokens will be made claimable by eligible addresses via an airdrop that goes live with the launch of mainnet on January 31. 
</Admonition>

### What is the total supply of MARS tokens and how much will be airdropped?

<Admonition type="info" title="">
The total supply remains unchanged at 1 billion. 64.4 million tokens will be unlocked and made claimable by those who held MARS during either of the two historical snapshots taken on Terra Classic, and the circulating supply will reflect the total number of tokens that are claimed.

### How can I claim the Airdrop?

<Admonition type="info" title="Answer:">
Eligible recipients will be able to access their tokens via Terra’s new interchain wallet, Station. Simply install the [latest version of Station](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/station-wallet/aiifbnbfobpmeekipheeijimdpnlpgpp) on Chrome and use the wallet address where you previously held MARS on Terra Classic to connect to Mars Hub. Your MARS tokens will automatically appear upon generation of your Mars Hub address.

### Which wallets are compatible with Terra Classic and can be used to claim the airdrop?

<Admonition type="info" title="Answer:">
Currently, eligible users can claim their airdrop using the [latest version of Station](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/station-wallet/aiifbnbfobpmeekipheeijimdpnlpgpp) which can be downloaded via your browser extension store or follow the guide on https://setup-station.terra.money

### Where can I check if I'm eligible for the Mars airdrop? 

<Admonition type="info" title="Answer:">
You can check your MARS airdrop eligibility now by changing your Station network to “testnet.” For detailed information on checking your airdrop, please read this [transmission](https://twitter.com/mars_protocol/status/1614342509399867394?s=20).
</Admonition>

### I was staking MARS for xMARS. Will this be included in the airdrop?

<Admonition type="info" title="Answer:">
Yes. For xMARS holders, their airdrop will be calculated using the xMARS:MARS ratio at each snapshot. For example, if you hold 10 xMARS, and the exchange ratio was 1 xMARS = 1.1 MARS, then you will be credited the same amount of the new MARS tokens as if you held 11 MARS at the time of the snapshot.

{/* ### How long will the airdrop be active?

<Admonition type="info" title="">
No deadline has been set. Users will be able to claim their MARS tokens at any time. If this were to change, a deadline would be shared with the community on Medium and Twitter.
</Admonition> */}

### I have another question regarding my airdrop. Where can I get additional assistance?

<Admonition type="info" title="Answer:">
Please create a support ticket in the Mars Discord with your Terra Classic address and as much information as possible at http://discord.gg/marsprotocol.
