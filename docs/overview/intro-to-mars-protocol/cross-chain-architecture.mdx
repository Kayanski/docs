# Cross-Chain Architecture

import IntroToMarsUrl from '@site/static/img/intro-to-mars.png';

To achieve the Mars v2 vision, Mars smart contracts must be deployed on a highly performant, decentralized platform offering a thriving DeFi ecosystem with many potential integrations and demand for leverage. Rather than selecting a single platform, Mars should be present on multiple chains ("Outposts"), wherever thereâ€™s demand for liquidity. Crucially, Mars should be present on these chains natively, because a competitive DeFi experience requires atomic, synchronous composability, which cannot be achieved by cross-chain calls.

This is the rationale that underpins the Mars Hub and Outpost topology illustrated below. Each Outpost is an integrated DeFi experience native to a specific chain that connects to the Mars Hub - a Cosmos SDK chain. The motivation behind Mars is simple: To become the leading DeFi credit protocol serving both individual users and dApps.
