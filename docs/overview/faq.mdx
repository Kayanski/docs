# FAQ

## General 

## Mars Hub

### What is Mars Hub?

<Admonition type="info" title="">
Mars Hub is a new blockchain in the Cosmos galaxy that serves as Marsâ€™ home base. From Mars Hub, Mars can launch outposts on other chains as it aims to become the core credit protocol for all of Cosmos and beyond.

Mars can first do this by deploying isolated instances of the Red Bank on different outposts, such as Osmosis. Later, Rovers can be planted alongside those outposts to offer advanced applications including leveraged yield farming.

Mars Hub itself serves as the communications layer between various blockchains. Mars Hub distributes protocol revenue generated by outposts and serves as a neutral home base for the Martian Council, which governs all of the Mars Protocol including its outposts on other chains.

### Do proposal submitters lose their MARS if their proposal fails?
<Admonition type="info" title="">
Yes. If a proposal fails to pass, the proposal submitter loses their MARS. Deposited MARS  gets sent to the staking contract so that MARS stakers receive the rewards.

### When/How often will MARS rewards be given to MARS stakers?
<Admonition type="info" title="">
In theory, anybody can call the rewards distribution function at any time. Delphi Labs will run a bot where the frequency of the distribution is being tuned according to the amount of rewards the protocol is getting (correlated with borrow rate). Currently, the call happens every 12 hours but may drop to 24 or 48.
