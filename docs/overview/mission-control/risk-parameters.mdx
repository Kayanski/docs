### Liquidation Bonus Methodology

#### Risky (non-stable) assets

Liquidation profitability analysis is done by simulating a price decline in 30 minutes equal to the worse 30-minute drawdown of the asset: 

- The first priority is for liquidations to be profitable at a considerable amount of blocks using different initial health factors (HFs). 
- The second priority is that for most HFs, there’s a period of profitable liquidations before the HF goes below the min such that liquidations lead to an increase in HF after liquidation.

#### Non-risky (stable) assets

Liquidation profitability analysis is done by simulating a price increase in 30 minutes equal to the max 30-minute increase of any asset in the money market: 

- The first priority is for liquidations to be profitable at a considerable amount of blocks using different initial HFs.
- The second priority is that for most HFs, there’s a period of profitable liquidations before the HF goes below the min such that liquidations lead to an increase in HF after liquidation.

{/* ## Caps

### Caps 1

Initial caps are defined as 10% of on-chain liquidity for the asset. On-chain liquidity includes both assets when considering XYK pools. In other words, if the ATOM/OSMO pool has 80M in liquidity, we consider both ATOM and OSMO to have 80M in liquidity from this pool.

The idea for the initial caps is to be very conservative at the initial stage after deployment. After a few weeks/months, if everything is working correctly we can increase caps.

### Caps 2

Governance could double caps in the second epoch to 20% on-chain liquidity. */}
