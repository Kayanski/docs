# Risk Parameters

## Initial Risk Parameters

### Red Bank - Global Params

| Param Name  | Value  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| Safety Fund Fee Share  | 50%  | % of protocol revenue that goes to safety fund, the remainder goes to stakers.  |
| Revision  | 1  | if a chain winds back blocks it should increment revision that is the reason for this blocks timeout for IBC transfer & seconds timeout for IBC transfer  |
| Slippage Tolerance  | 1%  | this is for swapping protocol revenue into axlUSDC/MARS before sending via IBC to the Mars Hub  |
| Close Factor  | 50%  | Max % of debt that's liquidatable  |

### Red Bank - Asset Specific Params

| Param Name  | Value ATOM   | Value OSMO  | Value axlUSDC  | Value stATOM  | Description  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

### Red Bank Deposit Incentives

| Param Name  | Value ATOM   | Value OSMO  | Value axlUSDC  | Description  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Emissions Per Second   | 0.1060950  | 0.23148200  | 0.04822500  | How many MARS will be rewarded per second   |
| Emissions Per Period   | 275,000  | 600,000  | 125,000  | How many MARS will be rewarded during the whole duration  |
| Start Time   |  |  |  | When should emissions calculation begin   |
| Duration (in seconds)    | 2,592,000  | 2,592,000  | 2,592,000  | How long should emissions calculations last   |

### MARS/OSMO pool

| Param Name  | Value  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| Swap Fee   | 0.2%  | The swap fee is the cut of all swaps that goes to the Liquidity Providers (LPs) for a pool. Suppose a pool has a swap fee s. Then if a user wants to swap T tokens in the pool, sT tokens go to the LP's, and then (1 - s)T tokens are swapped according to the AMM swap function.  |
| Exit Fee   | 0%  | The exit fee is a fee that is applied to LP's that want to remove their liquidity from the pool. Suppose a pool has an exit fee e. If they currently have S LP shares, then when they remove their liquidity they get tokens worth (1 - e)S shares back. The remaining eS shares are then burned, and the tokens corresponding to these shares are kept as liquidity.  |
| Future Governor   | No one  | Osmosis plans to allow every pool to act as a DAO, with its own governance in a future upgrade. To facilitate this transition, we allow pools to specify who the governor should be as a string. There are currently 3 options for the future governor. No one will govern it. This is done by leaving the future governor string as blank. Allow a given address to govern it. This is done by setting the future governor as a bech32 address. Lockups to a token. This is the full DAO scenario. The future governor specifies a token denomination denom, and a lockup duration duration. This says that "all tokens of denomination denom that are locked up for duration or longer, have equal say in governance of this pool".  |
| Weights   | 50/50  | This defines the weights of the pool - https://balancer.fi/whitepaper.pdf  |
| Smooth Weight Change Params    | NA  | This allows pool governance to smoothly change the weights of the assets it holds in the pool. So it can slowly move from a 2:1 ratio, to a 1:1 ratio. Currently, smooth weight changes are implemented as a linear change in weight ratios over a given duration of time. So weights changed from 4:1 to 2:2 over 2 days, then at day 1 of the change, the weights would be 3:1.5, and at day 2 its 2:2, and will remain at these weight ratios.   |
| Pool Creation Fee    | 100 OSMO  | Preset value from Osmosis   |

### External OSMO/MARS Pool Incentives on Osmosis 

| Param Name  | Value  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| Start time (UNIX)   |   | When should incentives begin   |
| Duration   | 14  | How long should a user have MARS locked up for to be able to start claiming incentives (1, 7, or 14 days)   |
| Epoch  | 30  | How many days should this gauge stay active for   |
| Reward  | 750,000  | How much total MARS do you want to reward while this guage is active   |

### TWAP Downtime Detector 

| Param Name  | Value  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
| Downtime   | 30 mins  | Downtime period options that you can query, to be: 30seconds, 1 min, 2 min, 3 min, 4 min, 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, 40 min, 50 min, 1 hr, 1.5hr, 2 hr, 2.5 hr, 3 hr, 4 hr, 5 hr, 6 hr, 9hr, 12hr, 18hr, 24hr, 36hr, 48hr.   |
| Recovery   | 120 mins  | Recovery seconds since the chain has been down for downtime period    |
