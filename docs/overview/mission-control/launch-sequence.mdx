# Launch Sequence

The Mars Hub launch sequence will come in three phases, the first of which has already begun:

- Alpha (Finished): A private testnet for developer and a limited number of Mars community members
- Ares (Ongoing): A public testnet available galaxy-wide
- Mainnet (January 31): The full launch of the Mars Hub mainnet

With the deployment of the public Ares-1 testnet, community members and potential validators can now test several key areas including:

- The MARS airdrop claiming process
- MARS staking
- Borrowing and lending via the Red Bank on the Osmosis testnet

On January 31, Mars Hub mainnet will go live with an initial genesis set of sixteen trusted and experienced validators: Block Pane, Chill Validation, Chorus One, Cosmology, CryptoCrew Validators, ECO Stake, Imperator.co, Injective, Jabbey, Needlecast, Notional, Oni, P2P Validator, polkachu, Simply Staking, Smart Stake.

To encourage a safe and secure launch environment, each genesis validator will receive a proportional delegation of 50 million MARS tokens (50 million / 16 validators), which will be returned to the Mars Hub community pool one month later. This temporary delegation will help protect the network from attack by a rogue validator that could potentially accumulate a large delegation of MARS shortly after genesis and begin manipulating transactions on-chain. 

After the first red block, anyone can launch a Mars Hub validator with their own MARS tokens or any MARS tokens delegated to their validator(s). Up to a maximum of 50 validators may join the active validating set. As more validators join the network and accumulate MARS delegations, the temporary delegation becomes unnecessary.
