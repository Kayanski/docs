With this change, the Health for a Credit Account turns Healthy at an HF of 1.5, has 100% Health at an HF of 3.5, and the Health of a liquidate-able Credit Account is now 0% instead of 10%.

### Release v2.0.3

#### Common
- A `Resync Oracle` button was added to the header; whenever the prices of the Pyth oracle on chain get stale or are too old, every user is now able to submit the price data on-chain via a transaction to keep the UI up to date with the latest prices. 
- A bug was fixed where checkboxes weren't selectable or deselectable because a `for` and `id` value were missing on the label and input combination.

#### Credit Accounts
- HealthFactor above 1 always returns 1% Health now to prevent 0% liquidation warnings for HF > 1 accounts.
- When a user is not on the Trade page, a click-away handler was added to the `AccountDetails` component to close it when clicking outside of it to prevent buttons from being overlapped by the `AccountDetails` slide-out
- When lending a tiny amount (0.000001) of an asset, the amount reported by the `AccountQuery` could become 0. To prevent showing 0 values, fractions of the smallest amount possible are now prefixed with the less than sign `<`

#### Trade
- A bug where your last selected `TradingPair` didn't load into the TradingView was fixed.
- The `TradingView` container has a preloader now.
