### Should I host my validator through a cloud provider or a "bare metal" server?

<Admonition type="info" title="">
When you use a cloud provider to host your validator, you are likely using a shared SSD, which is generally pretty slow. You will likely miss some blocks, which will effect your total up-time.

Bare metal servers generally offer better performance than cloud providers. There are some bare metal hosting services that allow for remote access to dedicated servers.
