# Basics

Create, import, export and delete keys using the CLI keyring.

## Create a new key

You can create a new key with the name demo-user as in the following example:

```bash
marsd keys add demo-user --coin-type 118
```

`--coin-type` is a parameter used when generating private keys from seed phrases, as defined in [SLIP-0044](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md). Most Cosmos chains use `118`. For the sake of a better interchain UX, we recommend everyone use `118`.

The following is an example response:

```
- name: demo-user
  type: local
  address: mars1quw5r22pxy8znjtdkgqc65atrm3x5hg6vycm5n
  pubkey: marspub1addwnpepqdct05khsxvtaaj0stuvayrpw0j8t6styr7vu05k3y63d5540ftuz8x6tsq
  mnemonic: ""
  threshold: 0
  pubkeys: []

**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

```

<Admonition type="warning" title="WARNING">
It is important that you keep the mnemonic for address secure, as there is **no way** to recover it. You would not be able to recover and access the funds in the wallet if you forget the mnemonic phrase. 
</Admonition>

## Restore existing key by seed phrase

You can restore an existing key with the mnemonic.

```bash
$ marsd keys add demo-user_restore --recover
> Enter your bip39 mnemonic
## Enter your 24-word mnemonic here ##
```

## List your keys

Multiple keys can be created when needed. You can list all keys saved under the storage path.

```bash
marsd keys list
```

The following is an example response:

```
- name: demo-user
    type: local
    address: ## Address of "Default" ##
    pubkey: ## Pubkey of "Default" ##
    mnemonic: ""
    threshold: 0
    pubkeys: []
  - name: Default_restore
    type: local
    address: ## Address of "Default_restore" ##
    pubkey: ## Pubkey of "Default_restore" ##
    mnemonic: ""
    threshold: 0
    pubkeys: []
```

## Retrieving key information

You can retrieve key information by its name:

```
# Account Address and its public key
$ marsd keys show demo-user --bech acc

# Validator Address and its public key
$ marsd keys show demo-user --bech val

# Consensus nodes Address and its public key
$ marsd keys show demo-user --bech cons
```

The following is an example response: 

```
- name: demo-user
  type: local
  address: marscncl1zdlttjrqh9jsgk2l8tgn6f0kxlfy98s3prz35z
  pubkey: marscnclpub1addwnpepq0ua07k8p3vrv5dap4pl77n4gjyyqsqrndzu0tdrr60ddhfg6ah0ck5ad5l
  mnemonic: ""
  threshold: 0
  pubkeys: []
```

## Delete a key

You can delete a key in your storage path.

<Admonition type="warning" title="WARNING">
Make sure you have backed up the key mnemonic before removing any of your keys, as there will be no way to recover your key without the mnemonic.
</Admonition>

```bash
$ marsd keys delete demo-user_restore1
Key reference will be deleted. Continue? [y/N]: y
Key deleted forever (uh oh!)
```

## Export private keys

You can export and backup your key by using the `export` subcommand:

```bash
$ marsd keys export demo-user
Enter passphrase to encrypt the exported key: ## Insert passphrase (must be at least 8 characters)##
-----BEGIN TENDERMINT PRIVATE KEY-----
kdf: bcrypt
salt: ## Salt of the key ##
type: secp256k1

## Tendermint private key ##
-----END TENDERMINT PRIVATE KEY-----
```
