# Marsd

This guide will explain how to install the marsd binary (Mars CLI) onto your system as a command-line interface tool for interacting with nodes on Mars Hub. 

While `marsd` is a requirement to run a full node, you don't have to run a full local node yourself to interact with the network. You can specify a remote node with the `â€”node` flag. 

With `marsd` connected to a remote node you can:
- Generates keys 
- Send transactions 
- Deploy and interact with contracts
- and more

## Setup

Login to your user account (you don't want to use root) and install some essential packages:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install build-essential git vim jq libleveldb-dev
sudo apt autoremove
```

Install the Go programming language:

```shell
curl -LO https://golang.org/dl/go1.18.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xfz ./go1.18.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv go /usr/local
go version
```

Configure related environment variables:

```bash
# vim .bashrc

export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export GOPATH=$HOME/.go
export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin:$GOROOT/bin
```

## Compile the Mars App Daemon

Clone the mars repo, checkout and install v0.0.0:

Download the Mars Hub source code and checkout the latest stable release, which in our case is v0.0.0:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mars-protocol/hub
cd hub
git checkout v0.0.0
```
The command to compile the app is defined in Makefile. For most Cosmos apps it is make install, which will generate an executable in your $GOBIN folder. 

```bash
make install
```

## Commands

This section describes essential commands for validators from marsd, the command line interface that connects a running marsd process.

#### `keys`

Manages Keyring commands. For a list of syntax and subcommands, see the keys subcommands.

#### `query`

Manages queries. For a list of syntax and subcommands, see the query subcommands. 

#### `start`

Runs the full node application with Tendermint in or out of process. By default, the application runs with Tendermint in process:

```bash
marsd start
```

#### `status`

Displays the status of a remote node:

```bash
marsd status
```

#### `tx`

Retrieves a transaction by its hash, account sequence, or signature. For a list of full syntax and subcommands, see the tx subcommands.

Syntax to query by hash:

```bash 
marsd query tx <hash>
```

Syntax to query by account sequence:

```bash
marsd query tx --type=acc_seq <address>:<sequence>
```

Syntax to query by signature:

```bash
marsd query tx --type=signature <sig1_base64,sig2_base64...>
```

#### `txs`

Retrieves transactions that match the specified events where results are paginated:

```bash
marsd query txs --events '<event>' --page <page-number> --limit <number-of-results>
```

Example:


```bash
marsd query txs --events 'message.sender=cosmos1...&message.action=withdraw_delegator_reward' --page 1 --limit 30
```
