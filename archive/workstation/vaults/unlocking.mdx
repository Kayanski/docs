# Unlocking

### Step 1: Head over to Farm tab in the Mars Web App: https://osmosis.marsprotocol.io/farm

<img src={Unlocking1Url} style={{ paddingBottom: 15 }} />

If you have locked tokens into a Mars vault, you should see your position under "Active Vaults". Select a position to manage. 

### Step 2: Select "Unlock"

<img src={Unlocking2Url} style={{ paddingBottom: 15 }} />

Closing your position requires an unboding period (e.g. 14 days) to unlock after which you need to manually close your position. Note that you will not earn fees and rewards during the unlock period. 

### Step 3: Sign and Confirm the Transaction

<img src={Unlocking3Url} style={{ paddingBottom: 15 }} />

### Step 4: Sign and Confirm the Transaction

<img src={Unlocking4Url} style={{ paddingBottom: 15 }} />

Once confirmed, your position will begin unlocking after which you will have to manually close your position.
