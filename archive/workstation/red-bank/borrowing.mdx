# Borrowing

### Step 1: Go to Red Bank tab in the Mars Web App: https://osmosis.marsprotocol.io/redbank

<img src={BorrowingStep1Url} />

Select an asset to borrow against your deposits. For example, ATOM.

### Step 2: Borrow Assets

Once you've selected an asset, select "Borrow" to advance. 

### Step 3: Select Deposit Amount

<img src={BorrowingStep3Url} />

You can either type the exact amount to borrow or use the percentage bar to determine the borrow amount. 

You can review a simulation of the transaction before confirming as well. Since we are borrowing assets, our total borrow amount should increase and our borrowing capacity should decrease. 

Select "Borrow" to advance.

### Step 4: Sign & Broadcast Transaction

You will be prompted to sign and broadcast your transaction using a compatible wallet. 

### Step 5: Congrats! You've borrowed assets from the Red Bank.

Now that you have borrowed assets, you can repay your loan and withdraw your original deposit amount.
