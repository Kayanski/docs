You can either type the exact amount to deposit or use the percentage bar to determine the deposit amount. 

You can review a simulation of the transaction before confirming as well. Since we are depositing assets, our total deposit amount and borrowing capacity should increase. 

Select "Deposit" to advance.

### Step 4: Sign & Broadcast Transaction

### Step 5: Congrats! You've deposited assets into the Red Bank.
